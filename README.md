# 🗄️ DBMS Project – Database Management System

This project is developed as part of the **DBMS (Database Management System)** course.  
The objective of this project is to design and implement a **well-structured database system** that efficiently stores, retrieves, and manages data using SQL.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
- To understand database design concepts
- To implement SQL queries on a real-world problem
- To perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- To ensure data consistency and integrity

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Database: MySQL / MariaDB / Oracle SQL  
- Language: SQL  
- Tool: MySQL Workbench / SQL Plus / phpMyAdmin  
- Platform: Windows

## 🗃️ Database Design
### Tables Used
- **Table 1:** Stores main entity information  
- **Table 2:** Stores related/secondary data  
- **Table 3:** Used for relationships (if applicable)

### Keys Used
- Primary Key  
- Foreign Key  
- Unique Key
